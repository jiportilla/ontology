# Purpose
Scripts serve much the same function as Jupyter Notebooks do.  

A script typically serves a very specific role and is not designed to be generic, extensible or even reusable.  It is not uncommon for script logic to be refactored into a service design pattern.

Whether a developer writes a python script or creates a Jupyter notebook is a matter for personal preference.
